              Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game
              developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense
              of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for
              Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is
              played in matches between two teams of five players, with each
              team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map.
              Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful
              character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and
              differing styles of play. During a match players collect
              experience points and items for their heroes to successfully
              defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
              A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's
              "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.

            <h4>Gameplay</h4>
            <p>
              Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in
              which two teams of five players compete to destroy a large
              structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient"
              whilst defending their own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the
              game is controlled using standard real-time strategy controls, and
              is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric
              perspective. Ten players each control one of the game's 123
              playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having their own
              design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two
              primary roles, known as the core and support.

            <h4>Development of Dota 2</h4>
            <p>
              Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of
              Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve to create a modernized
              remake for them in the Source game engine. It was released for
              Windows, OS X, and Linux via the digital distribution platform
              Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only open beta phase that
              began two years prior. The game is fully free-to-play with no
              heroes or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or
              otherwise unlocked. To maintain it, Valve supports the game as a
              service, selling loot boxes and a battle pass subscription system
              called Dota Plus.

            <h4>Neutral creeps</h4>
            <p>
              Neutral creeps do not attack unless provoked, and respawn over
              time if killed. The most powerful neutral creep is named "Roshan",
              who is a unique boss that may be defeated by either team to obtain
              special items, such as one that allows a one-time resurrection if
              the hero that holds it is killed. Roshan will respawn around ten
              minutes after being killed, and becomes progressively harder to
              kill as the match progresses over time. Runes, which are special
              items that spawn in set positions on the map every few minutes,
              offer heroes temporary, but powerful power-ups when collected,
              such as double damage and invisibility.
            </p>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
            <h4>Crucial Update</h4>
            <p>
              The move to the Source 2 engine in 2015 also added the "Arcade"
              feature, which allows for community-created game modes, with the
              more popular ones having dedicated server hosting by Valve. One
              popular example, known as Dota Auto Chess, had over seven million
              in-game subscribers by April 2019. Owing to its popularity, Valve
              met with the mod's developers, the Chinese-based Drodo Studio, to
              discuss directly collaborating on a standalone version. However,
              the two companies were unable to come to an agreement, with them
              both stating that it was in their best interest to develop their
              own separate games.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
              Valve adopted the word "Dota", derived from the original mod's
              acronym, as the name for its newly acquired franchise. Johnson
              argued that the word referred to a concept, and was not an
              acronym. Shortly after the announcement of Dota 2, Valve filed a
              trademark claim to the Dota name. At Gamescom 2011, company
              president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to
              develop a sequel with the already-identifiable brand. Holding the
              Dota name to be a community asset, Feak and Mescon filed an
              opposing trademark for Dota on behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC (then
              a subsidiary of Riot Games) in August 2010.
